# Don't Cross the Line
2 player game written in C. 

Note:
To be able to play this game your machine should have any C graphical Environment like Turbo-C etc.

Reason for creating this game:
- We were a part of AAC(Advanced Academic Center) in college during 1st year and at the end of the year we needed to submit a mini-project.
- So, my friends and I wanted to do something new and different in our field of interest which is gaming.
- I watch a lot of video game gameplay on youtube, where I stumbled on to this hilarious video(https://youtu.be/qgq9jcxKHKM?t=433)
